# CBZReader
A small tool for reading CBZ files (I wrote this in less than 24h ðŸ˜¶)

## How do I use it ?

Simply click the "Open CBZ File" button and select a CBZ File to open

You can click on the arrow buttons to select a different page (or use your arrow keys on your keyboard ðŸ˜„)

To read another CBZ file restart the software (Might fix this issue later)
